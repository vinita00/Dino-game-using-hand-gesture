## Dino Game Using Hnad Gestures

This Python script utilizes OpenCV and cvzone libraries to detect hand gestures and control the pressing of the space key on the keyboard based on the detected gestures. The script is designed to detect a specific hand gesture (all fingers down) to simulate pressing the space key, typically used for actions like jumping in applications or games.

### Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- cvzone
- directkeys (not provided)

### Setup:

1. Install Python (if not already installed) from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install required libraries using pip:

    ```
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install cvzone
    ```

3. Ensure the `directkeys` module is available or implement it as needed for simulating key presses. (Not provided in the code snippet)

### Usage:

1. Run the script (`hand_gesture_space_key.py`).
2. Ensure your webcam is properly set up and visible to the script.
3. Once the script is running, perform the hand gesture of placing all fingers down.
4. The script will detect this gesture and simulate pressing the space key, typically used for jumping actions.
5. Press 'q' to quit the script.

### Important Notes:

- This script is a basic demonstration of hand gesture control and might require adjustments or improvements for specific applications.
- Ensure proper lighting conditions and hand visibility for accurate gesture detection.
- Modify the code as needed, especially for adjusting gesture detection thresholds or expanding functionality.

### Acknowledgments:

- This script utilizes the `HandDetector` module from the `cvzone` library for hand tracking and gesture detection.
